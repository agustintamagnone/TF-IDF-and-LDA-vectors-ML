Task 2. Mitigation of the sparsity problem with Funk SVD
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compare how each method deals with sparsity, we evaluated user-based KNN and the Funk SVD model from the Surprise library
using the same train–test splits of the MovieLens 100k dataset. With 25% missing ratings, the best KNN configuration (K = 68)
reached a MAE of 0.7407, while SVD achieved a slightly lower MAE of 0.7376. In this case the dataset is still relatively dense,
so both algorithms behave similarly, although SVD still performs a bit better.

When increasing the missing ratings to 75%, the impact of sparsity became much clearer. The best KNN model (K = 72) saw its MAE
rise to 0.8130, while SVD obtained a noticeably lower MAE of 0.7727. This makes sense based on what we learned in class: KNN depends
heavily on users having enough co-rated items, so it struggles when the matrix becomes sparse. SVD, instead, learns latent factors
for users and items using all observed ratings, allowing it to generalize better even when very few ratings are available. As a result,
SVD handles the sparsity problem much more effectively than user-based KNN.
